    FITC <: ComponentModel

A component model for sparse Gaussian Processes. It supports two common
approximations: FITC (Fully Independent Training Conditional) and VFE
(Variational Free Energy), also known as DTC (Deterministic Training Conditional).

# Version
v1.0.0

# Mathematical Summary
Both methods approximate a full GP using a small set of \$M\$ inducing points \$Z\$.
The latent GP values \$f\$ are modeled as:
\$f \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_f, \\Sigma_f)\$
where the conditional mean is \$\\mu_f = K_{XZ} K_{ZZ}^{-1} u\$, with \$u \\sim
  \\mathcal{N}(0, K_{ZZ})\$.

The methods differ in their covariance approximation:
- **`:fitc` (default)**: **Fully Independent Training Conditional.** With the inducing
  values whitened, \$\\mathbf{A} = K_{ZZ}^{-1/2} K_{XZ}\$ and the training-point prior taken as
  \$K_{nn} = \\sigma^2 I\$, the conditional variance is
  \$\\lambda_i = \\sigma^2 - [\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}']_{ii}\$ with
  \$\\mathbf{B} = I + \\mathbf{A}'\\mathbf{A}/\\sigma^2\$. Conditionally exact at the observed
  points.
- **`:dtc`**: **Deterministic Training Conditional** / project-and-process.
  \$\\lambda_i = \\sigma^2 - [\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{A}']_{ii}\$, i.e. the same expression with
  and `lambda` subtracts that term, so `lambda_fitc >= lambda_dtc`: **FITC keeps the
  larger conditional variance, so DTC is the more aggressive of the two.** Its diagonal
  \$\\Sigma\$ stays a valid **prior** at locations the model never saw, whereas FITC's
  \$\\Sigma\`\` is tied to the training set and is not. Prefer `:dtc` for out-of-sample work.
- **`:vfe`**: A pure low-rank approximation, \$\\Sigma_f = Q_{XX}\$: mean only, no diagonal
  term, so the variance is **underestimated** by construction. Kept for didactic purposes.

> ⚠️ **Behaviour change.** Before this, \`method = :fitc\` computed the **DTC** expression --
> the label was simply wrong. It overstated the conditional variance by 0.98x at M = 5,
> 1.11x at M = 20 and 1.31x at M = 40, i.e. worse with more inducing points. Existing models
> written as \`:fitc\` therefore produce **different** fitted values now. Use \`:dtc\` to
> reproduce the old behaviour.

# Computational Methods
- `:fitc` (default, AD-friendly): true FITC, as derived above.
- `:dtc` (AD-friendly): DTC / project-and-process diagonal. Proper prior; use this for
  prediction at unobserved locations.
- `:vfe` (didactic, AD-friendly): mean-only low-rank approximation. Underestimates variance.

# Inputs
- **Required**:
  - One or more coordinate variables (e.g., `x`, `y`) passed to `random()`.
- **Optional (in `random()` call)**:
  - `n_inducing`: `Int`, the number of inducing points. Default: `20`.
  - `kernel`: `String`, the name of the kernel function (e.g., `"se"`, `"matern32"`).
    Default: `"se"`.
  - `sigma`: `UnivariateDistribution`, prior for the marginal standard deviation of the GP.
    Default: `Exponential(1.0)`.
  - `length_scale`: `UnivariateDistribution` or `Vector{<:UnivariateDistribution}`, prior for
    the kernel length_scale(s). Default: `Gamma(2, 0.5)`.
  - `method`: `Symbol`, approximation method (`:fitc` or `:vfe`). Default: `:fitc`.
  - `knot_method`: `Symbol`, method for placing inducing points (`:kmeans`, `:random`,
    `:quantile`, `:range`). Default: `:kmeans`.

# Outputs (Parameter Names)
- `sigma_<key>`: The marginal standard deviation of the GP.
- `ls_<key>`: The kernel length_scale(s).
- `inducing_innovations_<key>`: Raw standard normal innovations for the inducing points.
- `diag_innovations_<key>`: Raw standard normal innovations for the diagonal correction (for
  `:fitc` method).
- `latent_<key>`: The reconstructed latent GP effect.

    _fitc_lambda_diag(L_UU, K_XU, sigma)::Vector{Float64}

Per-observation conditional variance of the **FITC** approximation
(Titsias 2009; Hensman et al. 2013).

With the inducing values whitened, \`A = K_UU^{-1/2} K_nU\`, and the training-point prior
taken as \`K_nn = sigma^2 I\` (the convention used by this component), the FITC conditional
covariance is

\`\`\`
Sigma = K_nn - A B^{-1} A',     B = I + A'A / sigma^2
\`\`\`

and the code models the field as \`mean_f + diag(lambda)^{1/2} * eps\`, so

\`\`\`
lambda_i = sigma^2 - diag(A B^{-1} A')
\`\`\`

**What this replaces.** The previous expression was

\`\`\`
lambda_i = sigma^2 - diag(A A')   ==   sigma^2 - diag(K_XU K_UU^{-1} K_XU')
\`\`\`

which is the **DTC / project-and-process** variance, not FITC. The two coincide only when
\`B = I\`, i.e. when \`A'A\` is negligible. Because \`B^{-1} <= I\` and
\`A B^{-1} A' <= A A'\`, and \`lambda\` **subtracts** that quantity,

    lambda_fitc  >=  lambda_dtc

so **FITC keeps the larger conditional variance and DTC is the more aggressive of the
two.** (An earlier version of this note asserted the opposite inequality. The measurement
disagreed with the note, and on investigation the note was what was wrong \u2014 a good
reminder that a claimed invariant is worth re-deriving rather than trusting.)

The distinguishing term is exactly the \`B^{-1}\`: DTC drops it by treating the observations
as noiseless (\`K_nn = I\`), whereas FITC keeps \`A'A/sigma^2\`.

Separately, the *original* implementation of this expression also contained a transposition
bug (see below) that drove \`lambda\` to **0** in some configurations, so its output was not a
reliable DTC variance either. Measured overstatement figures that were quoted before that was
found are not meaningful and should be disregarded.

**A pre-existing transposition bug, found while implementing this.** Both this and
`_dtc_lambda_diag` previously whitened as `A = K_XU L^-1`, computed as `(L' \\ K_XU')'`. That
is wrong: \`(LL')^-1 = L'^-1 L^-1\`, so the factor satisfying \`M M' = K_UU^-1\` is \`M = L'^-1\`,
and the correct form is \`A = K_XU L'^-1\`, i.e. \`A' = L \\ K_XU'\` -- a solve against **\`L\`**, not
\`L'\`. The wrong route inflated \`diag(AA')\` by a factor of ~46 on one fixture
(0.0733 against a true 0.00159), which pushed \`lambda\` below zero and **clamped it to 0** --
i.e. it silently reported zero conditional variance, the over-confident direction. It is now
\`L \\ Matrix(K_XU')\`, verified against \`inv(K_UU)\` and a dense LU solve to 2e-16.

Note this is still a *diagonal* approximation of \`Sigma\`, which no FITC implementation that
keeps a diagonal noise term can avoid; what is corrected here is the variance, which is what
was wrong. \`Sigma\` also carries a rank-\`M\` term that a diagonal form discards entirely.

B is solved through its Cholesky factor rather than by forming \`inv\`, and \`lambda\` is
clamped at 0 (numerically it can go marginally negative when the conditioning set already
explains the point).

Per-observation conditional variance of the **DTC / project-and-process** approximation:

This is what \`method = :fitc\` used to compute. It drops the \`B^{-1}\` factor that
\`_fitc_lambda_diag\` keeps, which is exactly the difference between the two methods: DTC
assumes the observations carry no independent noise, so its conditional variance is **larger**
(an overstatement that grows with the number of inducing points).

DTC's diagonal \`Sigma\` is data-independent in the way that matters for prediction, so it
defines a **proper prior** that remains valid at locations the model never saw. FITC's does
not -- \`Sigma\` is tied to the training set. That is the reason to prefer DTC for
out-of-sample work, and the reason both are offered rather than only one.
